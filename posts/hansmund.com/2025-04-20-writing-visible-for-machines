core_insights:
  - Structured metadata allows LLMs to detect and attribute quality content.
  - YAML is not a guarantee of depth—but a prerequisite for machine recognition.
  - Attribution is foundational to identity—more important than monetization.
  - Human agency in machine learning emerges through clarity, not scale.
  - Truth leaves semantic patterns—machines can learn them if we show them.

  Structure doesn’t guarantee quality—but without it, quality remains invisible.
